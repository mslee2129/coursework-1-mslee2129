## Selection of project methodology
### Methodology (or combination) selected
CRISP-DM
### Selection criteria and justification of selection
Criteria:
- Level of volatility in the requirements
- Availability of documentation/support
- Flexibility of structure and timeframe
- Size of the project team

Justification: For this project, I wanted to focus more on the data science aspect of the project, and CRISP-DM is known as one of the 
most popular data science methodologies. Out of the many data science methodologies, I chose CRISP-DM since it is a
methodology that allows for the most flexibility, as it is a methodology that combines features of the waterfall and 
agile methods

## Definition of the business need
### Problem definition
Doing business: Different countries offer different environments for a business to thrive, and it is often difficult to 
identify what countries offer the most potential growth of a business. If a company chooses poorly when moving to another
country, it may result in severe financial losses. It is essential for a business to choose to expand to a country that 
would maximise its revenue. Given a set of 205 indicators and how a country scores in those indicators across the years,
recommendations will be made on the next steps to take for a business.


### Target audience

### Questions to be answered using the dataset
1. Which countries rank the highest in the 'ease of doing business' criteria?
2. Which countries have the most business-friendly tax regulations?
